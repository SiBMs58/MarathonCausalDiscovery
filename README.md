# 🏃‍♂️ Marathon Causal Discovery

Discover what really affects marathon performance — temperature, wind, humidity, age — using real-world marathon data and causal inference.

This project scrapes marathon result data, fetches historical weather information, applies the PC algorithm for causal discovery, and visualizes the resulting causal graph.

## 💡 What You'll Learn

- How to scrape and combine marathon + weather data
- Use conditional independence tests via the PC algorithm
- Normalize and prepare real-world data for causal inference
- Visualize causal graphs with `networkx` and `matplotlib`
